-I thought about adding more data fields to Guest and Receptionist classes like name, surname etc. but for sake of
readability i just used bare minimum.



bookRoom() makes a reservation to a room that is empty.
checkIn() confirms when the guest is arrived to the hotel.



Why did i use Map?
-Unique keys, so no duplicate user names or room numbers. Saves us from checking for duplicty and most of the error
handling.
-Supports null values.
